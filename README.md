# Releases-Regex Repository

Regular Expressions and ranked stream expressions (AIOStreams) for automatically **sorting and scoring** anime, movies, and TV show releases.
Patterns are mostly sourced from [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info) to score releases based on source quality (Remux, Bluray, WEB), release groups (both high-quality and low-quality), audio/visual tags (HDR, Atmos, DTS), and other quality indicators.
Wherever possible AIOStreams own tagging system is used, if something is not tagged correctly, create a bug over o´n either their github or discord.

## AIOStreams - Usage Instructions

AIOStreams uses a template-based import system. Templates are auto-updated with each release; you only need to re-apply them from the Template Wizard section in About to get the latest updates.

### Stream Expression Score-based Sorting

- **Sort Order Type**: `Global`
- **Sort Order**: `Library | Cached | Stream Expression Score | Bitrate (Estimate) | Resolution`
